# MancFugTDD

Manchester F# User Group Type Driven Development Workshop

This is based on [Domain Modeling Made Functional](https://pragprog.com/book/swdddf/domain-modeling-made-functional) by Scott Wlaschin.

## The Domain

The first thing is to understand the domain. Use a DDD approach to undercover this, lots of talking to your stakeholders,
event storming, etc. There's a lot of stuff here that doesn't involve the coding so we're going to skip it so we can
do the typing, but we do need a problem to look at. Our problem here will be the trusty old [checkout kata](http://codekata.com/kata/kata09-back-to-the-checkout/)

Takes a look...

Get some ubiquitous language:

- UnitPrice
- SpecialPrice
- Checkout
- PricingRule
